# ONLINE-SHOPPERS-INTENTION-10Alytics
This is the second project I did during my internship with 10Alytics

The primary purpose of the data set is to predict the purchasing intentions of a visitor to this particular storeâ€™s website and create a model to predict the transactions that will end in purchase.
The dataset was gotten from @10Alytics.
